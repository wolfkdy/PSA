Python String Automata

some experimental implemention of string automations write in python

(AhoCorasick AutoMata, 
Ukkonen's suffixTree, 
MYT's automata for compiling regex and lexical analysis)

most of the implementions are with low time complexity, 

however, with the slow speed of python, the overall performance is not very good

the best practise is implementing it with c/c++
