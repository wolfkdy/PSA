Python String Automata

some experimental implemention of string automations write in python

(AhoCorasick AutoMata, 
Ukkonen's suffixTree, 
MYT's automata for compiling regex and lexical analysis
LR1 and LALR(1) syntax parse table
)

most of the implementions are with low time complexity, 

however, with the slow speed of python, the overall performance is not very good

the best practise is implementing it with c/c++
